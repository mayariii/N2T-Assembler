# N2T-Assembler

The assembler program (Program.cs), written in C#,  was created as part of Project 6 submission for the Nand to Tetris course. (https://www.nand2tetris.org/course)

It translates programs written in the Hack assembly language into binary code that can execute on the Hack hardware platform built in the previous projects.

It takes in .asm file as an input, and generates and writes to a .hack file.
